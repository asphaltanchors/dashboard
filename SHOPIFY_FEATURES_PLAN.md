## Implementation Guidelines

### Standard Pattern for Each Feature

1. **Query File** (`lib/queries/[feature].ts`):
   ```typescript
   // ABOUTME: [Feature] queries and metrics
   // ABOUTME: [Brief description]

   export interface [Feature]Metric { ... }
   export async function get[Feature]Metrics(filters?) { ... }
   ```

2. **Page File** (`app/[feature]/page.tsx`):
   ```typescript
   // ABOUTME: [Feature] dashboard page
   // ABOUTME: [Brief description]

   - Header with breadcrumbs
   - Suspense-wrapped metric cards
   - Suspense-wrapped charts
   - Suspense-wrapped tables
   - Period selector (if applicable)
   ```

3. **Components** (`components/dashboard/[Feature]*.tsx`):
   - Follow existing pattern from `MetricCard`, `RevenueChart`, etc.
   - Use shadcn/ui components (Card, Table, Badge, etc.)
   - TypeScript interfaces for props
   - Proper loading states

4. **Navigation**:
   - Add to sidebar navigation
   - Group related features (Marketing, Customers, Analytics)

## Technical Considerations

### Database Performance
- Add indexes on frequently queried columns:
  - `fct_order_attribution`: `acquisition_channel`, `order_date`, `customer_id`
  - `fct_customer_marketing`: `customer_id`, `is_email_subscriber`, `first_order_date`
  - `mart_marketing_performance`: `order_month`, `acquisition_channel`

### Caching Strategy
- Use React Server Components cache for dashboard metrics (1-5 min)
- Implement Suspense boundaries for independent data fetching
- Consider materialized views for complex aggregations

### Data Quality
- Handle null values in UTM fields (many orders won't have attribution)
- Gracefully handle missing Shopify data for older orders
- Show data coverage metrics where appropriate

---

## Success Metrics
